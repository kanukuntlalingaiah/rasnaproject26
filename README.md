# Project 26: MasterChef Jr

The ingredients you will need for cookies are:
2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour.
1 teaspoon baking soda.
½ teaspoon baking powder.
1 cup butter, softened.
1 ½ cups white sugar.
1 egg.
1 teaspoon vanilla extract.

# steps...

The first step is to use room temperature butter. You can soften butter quickly with this trick or set the butter out 1-2 hours before you begin. Use a mix of Sugars: brown sugar, and white sugar together. Brown sugar helps soften the cookies and white sugar helps the cookies spread.  For chewier and more flavorful cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar. 

The next step is adding  eggs and Vanilla Extract: Eggs provide structure and richness, while vanilla adds flavor. Use Cornstarch in Dry Ingredients: Cornstarch, a thickening ingredient, is the secret weapon in this cookie recipe. 2 teaspoons give the cookies extra lift and leave them extra soft. You also need all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. 

Adding Dry Ingredients to Wet Ingredients: Combine all the ingredients, then add the chocolate chips. Chill the Cookie Dough: For extra thick chocolate chip cookies, chill the cookie dough for at least 1 hour. The colder the cookie dough, the less the cookies will over-spread. 

The next step is to set the oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit. While your oven is heating up, place small balls of cookie dough on a tray, use a spoon if you don’t want to get your hands dirty. 

The FINAL step is to take your cookies out of the oven, place them on a plate, AND enjoy them with a glass of milk. :)
